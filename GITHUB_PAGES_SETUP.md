# üìù GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## Enabling GitHub Pages

After the GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully, you need to enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings:

2. **Find Pages Section**
   - In the left sidebar, click on "Pages"

3. **Configure Source**
   - Under "Build and deployment"
   - Set **Source** to: `GitHub Actions`
   - (This should be automatically selected if the workflow has run)

4. **Wait for Deployment**
   - The first deployment may take 1-2 minutes
   - Check the Actions tab for deployment status: https://github.com/Warren573/jeutaime_app/actions

5. **Access Your Site**
   - Your site will be available at: https://warren573.github.io/jeutaime_app/
   - This link will be shown in the Pages settings once deployed
